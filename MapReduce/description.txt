command to run 
1.) get top keywords
cat alice.txt | python mapper.py | sort | python reducer.py | sort -nr | head > master_key.txt

2.) count keywords in chapters
cat alice.txt | python mapper.py | python ranker.py


System Overview

mapper.py reads stdin from alice.txt mapping key value pairs for each word. mapper.py ignores conjugates and filler words

the output of mapper.py is then sorted alphabetically, which aligns repeating words

reducer.py then counts redundant words and outputs a total for each word in the file

the output of reducer.py is then sorted in descending numerical order and the top 10 results are exported to master_key.txt

mapper.py is ran again and a modified reducer is used, ranker.py. ranker.py reads in the master keys and reads alice.txt inline looking for the keywords in master_key.txt, exporting tallies and whether or not keywords exist in each chapter to output.txt
